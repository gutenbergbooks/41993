<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not proposed to dwell, in the following pages, upon the
arguments that might be brought forward to prove that the
Sabbath is a Divine institution, established and sanctified by
the Creator on the seventh day, after all his works were finished,
and renewed to Israel on the descent of the manna. Nor
shall I attempt to show, from the Scriptures, that the Sabbath
is a Christian institution, as well as a Jewish ordinance; or
call your attention to the satisfactory reasons we have for observing,
as holy time, the first day of the week, and not the
seventh. No controversy will be maintained with any who
object to the Sabbath as commonly acknowledged by Christians.
He who sincerely seeks for instruction, has no need of
such argument; he already believes the Sabbath is the Lord's,
and that it is to be sanctified by a holy resting all the day.</p>

<p>The design of this Tract is to point out and illustrate the
most profitable manner of spending that part of the Lord's
day which is not employed in the public exercises of Divine
worship.</p>

<p>That your family, in each of its members, may profitably
spend <em>the Sabbath at home</em>,&mdash;</p>

<p>I. By Saturday evening have your worldly business arranged
to keep the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Few families pursue their business or trade, the same on the
Sabbath as on any other day. But there are many who do not
keep it as a sacred rest. If they do not plough and sow; if
the sound of the anvil and the saw is not heard in their shops;
if they do not, with open doors, buy and sell, and get gain;
there is another species of worldly business to which they do
attend, which, though not so much noticed by others, properly
belongs to the six days in which work may be done.</p>

<p>Such persons may be said to make arrangements, not to <em>keep</em>,
but to <em>profane</em> the Sabbath. "This matter need not be attended
to now, while other things press upon us&mdash;it may be postponed
until Sunday. That journey must be performed&mdash;that
plan laid with my neighbour&mdash;that errand accomplished <em>next
Sabbath</em>, or it will interfere with the business of the week."</p>

<p>To persons who thus feel, and who can thus act, I do not
propose to address myself; they do not desire information;
they have no wish to be instructed how they may more profitably
spend the Sabbath. They would like best to hear of
some new plan of retaining the Christian name, while they
drive on their own trades and find their own pleasures.  No
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>argument would be more pleasing to them than one which
might go to prove that because the Sabbath was made for <em>man</em>,
therefore man may use the Sabbath according to his own pleasure.
But to you, my readers, who I trust are desirous of
being taught your duty, and are willing to be exhorted that
you may enter upon its performance, I would say, on Saturday
arrange your worldly business to keep the Sabbath. It must
not be forgotten, that this is much more easily done in some
families than in others. It depends upon the number of the
household,&mdash;upon the occupation of the different members,&mdash;whether
they all think alike on the sanctification of the Sabbath,
and are disposed to unite in bringing their worldly affairs
to such an issue, that they may have <em>all</em> the following day for
holy rest. With some, Saturday evening is a time of more
leisure than any other of the week; while with not a few, it
is a time of more hurry and pressure of business,&mdash;collecting
debts, paying bills, fulfilling promises of the shop or store,
than will again be encountered until Saturday returns. The
cares of the week will press us, until steadfastly resisted. This
resistance ought to be made with holy resolution, and sufficiently
early to secure the Sabbath from being profaned.</p>

<p>The arrangements of the shop, the labours of the farm, and
the business of the office or counting house, must be closed on
Saturday evening, or in vain we wake early the next morning
to enjoy the Sabbath. Did we look no further than to success
in this world's affairs, a maxim of prudence and economy
would be, to bring our plans, as far as possible, to a close once
every week. It promotes order in the transaction of business.
It gives efficiency to our labours. We <em>finish</em> more, which is
the same as saying we <em>do</em> more, than if our business were
suffered to run on without interruption the year round. We
must also take into account the vigour of both body and mind,
which an entire day of rest from care and labour imparts. And
who that reads his Bible, will think it strange for me to say,
that the blessing of the Lord is upon him who sacredly regards
the Sabbath? "If thou turn thy foot away from the Sabbath,
[that is, do not impiously trample upon it,] from doing thy
pleasure on my holy day, and call the Sabbath a delight, the
holy of the Lord, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing
thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasures, nor speaking
thine own words, then shall thou delight thyself in the
Lord, and I will cause thee to ride upon the high places of the
earth, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father, for
the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it." Isa. lviii. 13, 14.
What was the heritage of Jacob? The favour of God, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>the richest productions of the field, and an increase of every
worldly possession.</p>

<p>We may appeal to observation. The influence of the Sabbath
upon the <em>rich</em> is not so easily discerned. But among those,
who, in a peculiar manner, receive day by day their daily
bread, it may be seen. And unless I greatly err, it will be
found, that those families who observe the Sabbath, and attend
upon its public and private duties, with desire to be profited,
have, in comparison with those who do not thus regard the
day unto the Lord, more peace of mind, more family comforts,
and are better prepared to meet the demands which every
year brings against them. Can a man rob God and prosper?
rob Him, who can withhold our common blessings, or, as he
has threatened, can curse them after given! Mal. ii. 2. Then,
from consideration of both temporal and spiritual interest, let
the Sabbath be regarded as a day of holy rest from the morning
to the evening. And that we may attain to this, let us previously
arrange all that pertains to our respective occupations,
that we may wait upon the Lord without distraction of mind.</p>

<p>Another matter that has an important bearing upon the sanctification
of the Sabbath, you will permit me to mention.
Though the institutions of Moses are not, as a system, binding
upon Christians, yet from them we may often infer what is
important in regard to the proper observance of that which is
given us in their stead. Among other commands to Israel for
the profitable keeping of the Sabbath, they were required to
abstain, on the seventh day, from all work, except the preparation
of their necessary food. How this command was to be
understood we learn from Exod. xvi. 23. On the descent of
manna, Moses said to the people, "To-morrow is the rest of
the Holy Sabbath unto the Lord; bake that which ye will
bake to-day, and seethe that ye will seethe; and that which
remaineth over, lay up for you, to be kept until the morning."
I am not about to say, that no family observes the Christian
Sabbath, who does not fulfil the letter of this command. But
may I not safely say, that the more nearly it is observed, the
more profitably the day may be spent? If our tables are provided
for on Saturday; if we bake that which we must bake,
and seethe that we must seethe, and lay them up for the morrow,
will not those members of the family, who attend public
worship, have more time to devote to the reading of the Scriptures,
to meditation, and other duties of Sabbath morning?</p>

<p>What shall we say of those whose lot it may be to remain
at home part of the day? Why, it is commonly answered,
that as they have nothing else to do, they may as well prepare
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>dinner for those at church. But have they nothing to do?
Have they no Bible to read? No Scripture lessons to prepare
for Sabbath School? No Catechism, that may be most conveniently
committed to memory by them when left alone? Is
meditation, and is prayer the duty of those only who are privileged
with attending public worship? Have persons who
labour in our families for hire, no need of one day of rest in
seven? If <em>fasting</em>, as all ages and good men of every country
have acknowledged, is promotive of the devotion of the heart,
denying the appetite in some small degree cannot be injurious.
And why should it be thought unreasonable that persons in
our employment, and our children, who early notice the character
of our religion, might receive some good impression, as
to the nature of the Sabbath, by seeing us deny ourselves what
on other days is innocent and right? I am not pleading that
the Sabbath be made a day for afflicting our souls, but that we
should not permit our sensual desires to interfere with our
spiritual delight. On days of unusual political interest, we count
it no sacrifice to be <em>deprived</em> of a regular meal, or to take of
that which comes to hand, because our delight is elsewhere.
Let the same interest be felt in the Sabbath, and we shall be
equally loth to permit that, which might be done on Saturday,
to interfere with our enjoyment and spiritual profit. If each
family would, on the preceding day, prepare, as far as practicable,
for their table on the Sabbath, would not much time be
redeemed for the appropriate duties of the Lord's day?</p>

<p>To mention every thing that might, with advantage, be attended
to on Saturday, bearing upon the Sabbath, would be
to recount the events of each family&mdash;they all influence our
profiting, though, when viewed separately, they seem hardly
worthy of notice.</p>

<p>I have known the men of more than one family to spend the
best part of Sabbath morning, in making such alterations in
their carriage and harness as were necessary, in order to
attend meeting; which changes might much better have been
made the evening before.</p>

<p>In other households you will find the apparel appropriate
to the Sabbath, must be subjected to certain emendations and
improvements, before the family can be prepared for public
worship. By this time the morning is gone, but the Sabbath
of holy rest has not yet begun. How much more profitable,
that all which pertains to our persons, "from a thread to
a shoe-latchet," should be set in order before the Sabbath
arrives, that as we have but one holy day in seven, we may
enjoy it all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>A full answer with many, is, "If I do nothing worse than
these, I shall have little cause for alarm;"&mdash;to which I will
only reply,&mdash;This is not the language of one seeking to be
instructed, and desiring to honour God. It is not the spirit
of the fourth commandment, which is, "Remember the Sabbath
day, to keep it holy. Six days shalt thou labour and
do <span class="smcap">ALL</span> thy work: but the seventh is the Sabbath of the Lord
thy God: in it thou shalt not do <span class="smcap">ANY</span> work, thou, nor thy
son, nor thy daughter, nor thy man-servant, nor thy maid-servant,
nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within thy
gates." It is not according to the example and instruction
of our pious fathers, who taught us that "the Sabbath is to
be sanctified, by a holy resting all that day, even from such
worldly employments and recreations as are lawful on other
days; and spending the whole time in the public and private
exercises of God's worship, except so much as is to be taken
up in the works of necessity and mercy."</p>

<p>II. That you may profitably spend the Sabbath, let all the
members of your family, as far as practicable, be at home on
Saturday evening, and there pass the following day.</p>

<p>This will promote peace of mind, of parents especially.
If members of your household are from home, you know not
to what dangers they are exposed, or into what temptations
they may be led. But if they be with you, under the same
roof, this anxiety is in a great degree prevented.</p>

<p>It conduces to the good order of a family, for all its members
to be at home. If the parents are absent, there is danger
of the house becoming a scene of noise and disorder, that
does not well comport with the solemnity of the Sabbath. If
there was nothing more to be said in favour of families never
being deprived, on the Lord's day, of their presiding members,
we might reasonably plead, that much evil would be
prevented by the restraint of their presence. But there are
not negative advantages only; there are positive ones also,
which shall soon be mentioned.</p>

<p>In every well ordered family, where industry and economy
are found, there are certain duties assigned, by custom or
common consent, to each member of the household. These
are attended to by the persons on whom they devolve, during
the week, much to the facilitating of business, and the prevention
of trouble or confusion. Now if such be found a
measure of expediency during days of labour, we may safely
presume upon its utility when applied to the Sabbath. If it
is important to save moments of <em>six</em> days, it cannot be less
desirable to secure the remnants of <em>one</em> day. But if part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>your family are from home on Sabbath morning, a double
portion of necessary duties devolves upon those who remain;
and as the duties they are called to perform in the place of
the absent members, are not their own regular share of
domestic cares, much additional time and attention will be
demanded properly to fulfil them. It requires scarcely a
trial, to convince us that the <em>whole morning</em> may thus be lost,
in performing what devolves upon others; and that when
the hour of public worship arrives, the mind is hardly composed
sufficiently to determine whether you can attend meeting
or not.</p>

<p>In addition to the quietness and good order secured by the
presence of the parents or heads of the family on the Sabbath,
it is important that they be at home all the day, that their
household may not be left without family instruction. We
all know that the best children need frequently to be reminded
of their books, and encouraged and aided in their lessons. If
the parents are from home, little will probably be done in the
reading of the Scriptures, or learning the Catechism. Besides,
there is great danger that the children will be suffered
to pass without examination, or any systematic instruction in
the doctrines and duties of religion, if the heads of the family
are not at home all the day. For the reason just given, there
will be no lessons for catechising: the parents may very
probably be from home at the stated hour for family instruction:
or, when they return, may feel too much wearied to
attend to the duty; so that there is no way of securing to the
children that teaching which they must have, but for the parents
to be at home on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>To secure the same desirable end, it is no less necessary
that all the <em>children</em> spend the day in the bosom of the family.
If they are not present, and put themselves in the way of
instruction, they cannot be taught. For all the family to be
at home on the Sabbath, is one of the best preservatives
against temptation. Is it possible for young people of different
households, to associate on the Lord's day, and not be
led into the sin of light and vain conversation? Can the
world be shut out of such company, no matter how strict
the injunctions of parents, and sincere the resolutions of those
going from home?</p>

<p>This leads us to speak of another matter, which ought not
to be passed over, because it unavoidably, and to a degree of
which many are not aware, interferes with the profitable
sanctification of the Sabbath. I refer to <em>Sunday visiting</em>;&mdash;not
that which commonly passes under the name, when several
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>members of one family go and spend the day with their
friends, as they would any afternoon in the week. Surely,
none calling themselves Christians, and acknowledging that
we have a Christian Sabbath at all, can approve of such a manner
of spending the day. Nor is allusion made to visits to
the sick, put off from day to day, that they may be paid
without loss of time on the Sabbath, crowding the room of
the patient, and instead of conferring a kindness, often inflicting
an injury of many days' continuance.</p>

<p>The custom to which I refer is different in character from
both of these, but perhaps not less hurtful. It is the <em>connecting
of visits with an attendance upon public worship</em>. I
should be exceedingly sorry to wound the feelings of any one,
whose age, or distance from meeting, may render it difficult
both to go and return home the same day, without rest or
refreshment. The duty of such is to accept of the kindness
of their friends, either on Saturday night or after sermon on
the Sabbath. Religion requires us to afford such entertainment
to those who labour under disadvantages that do not
lie upon us. But is it not very common for Christian families
to form their plan for visiting their friends, not during the
week, but on Saturday evening, to accompany them to meeting
in the morning; or to go with them from public worship and
spend the afternoon in their family? How many such visits are
made profitable? In whose family does not the conversation
become worldly and of little worth? In what visiting circle
are the nature of religion, and the experience of the heart,
the subjects upon which all unite profitably to pass the time?
The difficulty with us all, of answering such questions without
confusion, ought to lead us to ask, Is there not something
wrong in such visits? When we engage in them, we are
from our families. But home is our place on the Sabbath.
We put ourselves in the way of temptation, before which,
repeated trials have shown that we must fall. The family
that receives the visit is deprived of as much of the Sabbath
as we spend with them; for a cold family dinner, such as
best adorns the Sabbath, is altogether out of character when
our friends become guests; and to spend much time in reading
even the Bible, while visitants are sitting by, would be
thought strange indeed. The various conversation, the communicating
and receiving of neighbourhood intelligence,
leaves the minds neither of those who pay, nor of those who
receive the visit, in a state properly to spend the remaining
part of the Sabbath. While, therefore, it is easy to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>what we esteem duty a burden, and we may hastily lay down
rules which a few weeks will show us are no aid in religion,
but a Pharisaical hinderance, yet, between this and the opposite
extreme, of making the Sabbath a day of sociability and
feasting, there is a wide field. The difficulty of determining
upon duty, lies in this;&mdash;Sunday visits are not wholly wrong;
some of them are right; it would be sin <em>not</em> to visit the sick
and dying. How then shall we determine when it is right,
and when wrong, to visit on the Sabbath? What rule can
we lay down? General rules are of little worth; each case
has something peculiar in it, so that the mere letter of a law
may be set aside. But let an enlightened conscience, governed
by the fear of God, direct us. We are not to ask, What is
fashionable? Do not many Christian families pay social
visits on the Sabbath? Will it be considered inconsistent
with my profession of religion to spend a few hours from
home, or only twenty minutes with my friends at the next
door?&mdash;Rather ask, Is it right? Shall I gain spiritual
strength by doing so? Will my example be happy in its
influence upon my children and others? Is this the way,
that, above all, I would recommend to persons seriously asking,
How may I most profitably spend the Sabbath day?</p>

<p>III. In order profitably to pass the Sabbath at home, we
must imbibe and cherish the impression that it is a holy day.</p>

<p>It is in vain to form resolutions, until conscience be set
about <em>her</em> work. Our promises will last only until some
worldly enjoyment bribes us silently to set them aside.
Public sentiment is of little weight in favour of the profitable
observance of the Sabbath; because it is of every possible
shade. This holy day may be spent almost as we please;
the laws of the land, to save it from profanation, being, as in
all times past, a dead letter; prevailing custom allowing of
almost every kind of recreation, if not of labour. Each denomination
of those calling themselves Christians, having
their own views and claiming the indulgence of their own
practice. While some are more strict, others will hardly
admit that the Sabbath is more sacred than any other day.
Spend the time as you please, you will be in character: you
will be sustained. You may search the Scriptures, and engage
with your family in pious conversation, and no one has
a right to murmur. You may spend the day in idleness and
sleep, or in conversation about worldly business: the professional
man may arrange the papers and books of his office,
ready against Monday morning; we may wander over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>fields, or visit our next door neighbours, or ride out in the
afternoon, and who dare seriously complain?</p>

<p>A store keeper may post his books; another may load his
wagon for market; a printer may set his types; young people
may spend the day in reading novels; I may go into my study
and work problems in navigation, or for literary improvement,
read Latin and Greek in heathen authors, and we shall none
of us be disturbed; we may quietly pursue our respective
courses the year round. Spend the time as we may, we are
still in character, and will be sustained by the popular voice.
Besides, that influence which is derived from the regard we
have for what others think or say of us, will not control us
in the bosom of our own families. We are there withdrawn
from public view. The more retired we are, the more independent
we feel, of either the approbation or ridicule of others.
Though a regard for the character of our families may influence
us, in some considerable degree, to sanctify the Sabbath,
while there is no inducement to the contrary; yet when we
most need it, such help fails us. Neither our own reputation,
as respecters of religion, nor the influence we might exert for
the honour and happiness of our families, will be sufficient
to overcome strong temptation.</p>

<p>But let the mind once come under the control of the belief,
that the Sabbath is the Lord's, and that it is to be observed in
holy rest all the day, and we have advanced farther in the sanctification
of the Sabbath, than if we had matured a score of
rules, and solemnly bound ourselves to keep them every one.</p>

<p>Do we find it difficult to rise as early on that day as during
the week, that with the morning we may commence our duties?
Let conscience speak, and we shall wake early. Let our love
to God, and his service, only be as strong as our attachment
to the things of the world, and no more of the Sabbath will be
wasted in slumber, than of Monday morning. Men who labour
through the week, contend for this indulgence; that they are
wearied and need rest: besides, that the Sabbath is given for
rest. But, no reader of the Bible can say, that it is the rest of
indolence and spiritual inactivity. The worship of God does
not commonly demand the labours and exercise of the body;
the mind only is called into healthful action; and this is also
refreshing to the body. In answer to the plea, that being worn
down with the cares of the week, and its toils, we may, consistently
with duty, lie later on Sabbath morning than any other,
it may be asked, Have we a right to expend our strength during
the week, so as to unfit us for the duties of the Sabbath when
they arrive? If we found ourselves disinclined early to seek
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>the Lord, last Sabbath, are we not bound to guard against such
languor, when this holy day shall again dawn? Is not duty
plain, that we ought to relax our labours on Saturday, that we
may not lose the most precious hours of the Lord's day? Were
we <em>our own</em>, we might exercise our pleasure. But we are not.
Man's chief end is, to glorify God, and enjoy him, in this
world, as well as hereafter. Suppose you hire a man, to
labour for you&mdash;you have a right to all his time; but you give
him five days in the week for his own employment on condition
that he will devote himself wholly to your work on the
sixth. Has this man a right, so to arrange his business, and
expend his strength, during the five days he labours for himself,
that when the sixth day arrives, he cannot rise until late,
nor commence his work until the morning be nearly past?</p>

<p>Again, there are many things about which we perhaps have
no difficulty, as respects ourselves; we may perform them or
not, on the Sabbath, without injury. But the influence we
may exert upon others, is with every conscientious man a
serious consideration. In cases of difficulty, how shall we
determine what is right? Not by expediency, or custom, or
inclination, or a spirit of independence. These cannot be
safely trusted. Let us call to mind, that the Sabbath is the
Lord's; and that we are bound to glorify him, both in our
conduct and our influence; and we shall not probably find
much difficulty in deciding at once, what it is our duty to do.
The same rule will also apply to cases of doubt, in respect to
ourselves. Our reputation, or interest, or feelings give us
their counsel, while other considerations may be placed over
against these. Neither the one nor the other affords us any
certain aid in determining upon what is our duty. But if the
fear of God rule in our hearts, and his holy day be very precious
to us, and its honour dear, the question, before so perplexing,
becomes a very plain one. What must I do, in the
observance of the Sabbath, <em>to promote the glory of God</em>? If
we will allow conscience to speak, her voice may be heard;
if we attend to her admonitions, guided by the light of Scripture,
we shall not commonly, we shall not often, be left in
doubt what is duty. For example, you may feel much wearied
with the exercises, public and private, of the morning;
and the recreation of a walk for half an hour in the afternoon,
would be very refreshing to your exhausted system. But
there are considerations to be weighed against this. As to
profit in the street, or upon the frequented road, that is out
of the question. Equally vain would be the attempt to keep
the thoughts from wandering upon all that tempts the eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>and ear. And then the effect that may result to others, must
be taken into the account, and the light in which your conduct
will be viewed, as connected with the sanctification of
the Sabbath.</p>

<p>The question is now easily decided, because duty appears
plain. A great advantage also, attending this manner of solving
difficulties is, that the decision is final; there remains no
cavilling, when the determination is once made, <em>in the fear
of God</em>. If you wish to keep the Sabbath profitably, and
with enjoyment to yourself and family, labour to attain to,
and cultivate the impression, that it is the Lord's day, and,
therefore, to be kept holy.</p>

<p>IV. Attendance, as far as practicable upon the public duties
of religion, contributes much to the profitable observance of
the Sabbath at home.</p>

<p>The language of Scripture would lead us to this. "Six
days shall work be done; but the seventh day is the Sabbath
of rest, and holy convocation; ye shall do no work therein;
it is the Sabbath of the Lord in all your dwellings." Lev.
xxiii. 3. The Sabbath at home is well united with the holy
convocation of the people of God, in the public ordinances
of religion. If we consult the history of the Church, we
shall find this to have been the opinion of the pious in every
age. The Jewish nation, Christians in the time of the apostles,
and the professing people of God in all countries since
their day, have weekly assembled themselves together.</p>

<p>Public worship promotes the observance of the Sabbath at
home, by affording that instruction which is necessary to the
proper performance of our duty. Though comparatively
little time is spent on the Sabbath, in teaching publicly the
doctrines of religion, and the duties that flow from them, yet
there will be found a very great difference in the views of
those who regularly hear the gospel, and of such as never
enter a worshipping assembly. This does not wholly arise
from the public instructions of the Sabbath,&mdash;those who hear
the gospel are constrained to search for themselves, and to
use other means to learn the duty which God requires of man.
Among other things, they will soon learn that the Sabbath is
to be sanctified, by a holy resting all the day, and that if they
mean to do what is right, they must perform this duty also.</p>

<p>But we may come to a knowledge of our duty, and yet
have no inclination to do what is required. We need to be
exhorted and encouraged. This is enjoined upon those who
preach the gospel. They are commanded, not only to reprove
and rebuke, but also to exhort; to help such as are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>discouraged, and to strengthen the feeble. And here, again,
it will be found, that notwithstanding the multitude who hear
the word preached, but observe not the Lord's day as a holy
rest, they, who in any community sanctify it, are those who
on that day attend public worship. I much question if a
family, neglectful of public worship, can be found, that sanctifies
the Sabbath at home.</p>

<p>Again, the assembling of ourselves together, regularly on
the Sabbath, greatly contributes to preserve that holy day
from the danger of being profaned. All persons feel the
confinement of the Sabbath. Nature seems to demand some
recreation, both of body and mind. This is afforded us in
public worship. The preparing of ourselves to assemble,&mdash;the
ride, or walk, if we live near;&mdash;the variety in the exercises
of the sanctuary,&mdash;the reading, singing, prayers, and sermons,
are exceedingly refreshing to such as have a heart to enjoy
them. They send us home better prepared for spending
profitably the remainder of the day, than if all the time had
been passed in our own dwellings. The remark of one who
was deprived of preaching an entire day, we have probably
all found true in our own experience,&mdash;That a Sabbath without
public worship, when we have all the time to spend in
duties at home, is no gain to the reading of the Scriptures.
For want of variety in our duties, we become languid, and
profit but little.</p>

<p>Attendance upon public worship is favourable to a profitable
spending of the Sabbath at home, because it promotes religion
generally. It is in the house of God that we are taught
what we must do to be saved, and how we are acceptably
to serve our Creator. Parents and children are taught their
relative duties, and are dismissed with pressing exhortation
not to defer the paying of their vows. It is in the worshipping
assembly, that the affections are moved, and interested
for the glory of God. Here it is, that our consciences most
closely press us with the important question, What must
I do to work the works of God? In the ministry of reconciliation,
dispensed to the assemblies of the Sabbath, sin is
pointed out and reproved; negligence in duty reprimanded;
the honour of religion defended; the sanctification of the
Lord's day pleaded for; the feeble strengthened, and the
wavering mind confirmed;&mdash;every Christian grace, in its order,
becomes the subject of special consideration, and every duty,
according to our station in life, is, with arguments to its
immediate and constant performance, explained and pressed
upon us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Then, let every one, who would profitably observe the
Sabbath <em>at home</em>, conscientiously and faithfully attend public
worship. This will save him and his family from many
temptations to profane the Lord's day, and will afford him
instruction, strength, and encouragement for the performance
of his duties.</p>

<p>V. Let the time not spent in public worship, be past at
home in exercises becoming the sacredness of the Sabbath.</p>

<p>Parents will permit me here to remind them of the duties
they owe their households. Not to suffer the day to pass
without important instruction to their children. It may very
properly, and indeed ought to be various in its character, to
suit the youthful mind; but all bearing upon the spiritual
welfare of both parents and children. After returning from
meeting, make inquiry about the text; what subject was
treated in the sermon; particularly if any thing was said to
children or the younger members of the family: whether
any thing sinful in them was pointed out, and any good thing
recommended for them to do. How much better would be
the influence, upon our families and ourselves, of this course,
than what must arise from a critical spirit, which often, not
only keeps possession of the heart while we hear, but dictates
all that is said of the sermon after we have returned home.</p>

<p>Children ought to be taught their catechism on the Sabbath,
and aided in their Sunday school lessons. The old Presbyterian
method was, to devote Sabbath evening to instruction
out of the Scriptures, and the reciting of the Shorter Catechism.
A means of grace so important, ought not to be suffered by
any family to fall into decay. It is of moment also, that not
only in the conduct of the parents, the younger members may
see the sacredness of the Lord's day, but that they should be
instructed in the nature of the Sabbath; by whom it was
appointed, and for what purposes; how it is to be sanctified;
what we may do, and from what we must refrain. This
would make children intelligent, and would stir up parents
also to acquaint themselves more perfectly, through the aid
of the excellent standards of our Church, and other sources
of correct interpretation of the Scriptures, with what they
may, from want of incentives to attention, but partially understand.</p>

<p>Children ought to receive, at times, that instruction which
is exclusively <em>religious</em>; ought to be conversed with affectionately
about their souls, and the truth prest home to their
hearts. If this be attempted, in the hurry of business during
the week, though the seed may prosper, yet it is not probable.
The Sabbath is the most encouraging time. The mind of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>parent is then in a favourable state; the solemnities of the day
contribute much to success, and prepare the hearts of your
children to receive some good impression. Those Sabbath
evening exhortations, though without even apparent effect at
first, will follow your children, when your anxiety can no
more watch over them, and may lead them to salvation, after
your souls have gone to enjoy it in glory.</p>

<p><em>Reading</em> is an exercise that ought to be particularly attended
to on the Sabbath. We would do well to converse intimately
and constantly with pious men in their writings, when we
are not called to other duties. The great variety of journals
and semi-romances, with which the professedly religious
presses teem, has, at least, a questionable effect upon intelligent
and vital religion. If the Sabbath were more devoted to
the study of such books as Doddridge's Rise and Progress,
Scougal's Life of God in the Soul, Flavel on Keeping the
Heart, Owen on the Spirit, and Baxter's Saints' Rest, we
would <em>feel</em> in ourselves, and others would <em>see</em> in us an increase
of grace, which it is to be feared we do not enjoy from the
food prepared to our fastidious palates.</p>

<p>Above all, let the Bible be the book that is to be read on
the Sabbath. The day is holy, the book is also holy. In
the hurry of business through the week, we often feel that
we are deprived of both enjoyment and profit in searching the
Scriptures. But on the Lord's day we have leisure. All
around us is quiet. The solemnities of the day give additional
interest and sacredness to what we read. We can read much
more at once than during the week, and profit by noticing
the connexion of one passage with another. Many persons
complain that they have little time to read, during the six
days of labour. Such ought to devote, I was going to say,
<em>all</em> the Sabbath, to the study of the Scriptures. This was
very much the method of our fathers. As they had few books,
the <em>Bible</em> claimed their attention on the Sabbath. And the
nature of their religion, and their eminent piety, may well
recommend to us their example.</p>

<p>Members of the same family ought, on the Sabbath, to
converse together on the state of their souls. Much may
be done for their comfort and the promotion of religion, by
thus communing together. We may speak in public of
experimental religion, make the exercises of others the subject
of remark; we may talk to Christians of other families about
religion; but if our children and members of our household
never hear us speak of these things, when only our own
little circle is around us, they will very readily infer that it
is not a subject greatly interesting to us. That which possesses
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>our hearts we love to dwell upon in conversation with
our own family.</p>

<p><em>Meditation</em>, though a difficult duty, is essentially necessary
to a healthful state of mind, and is suited to no day more than
to the Sabbath. The cares of the world are then shut out, and
every thing seems to constrain us to turn our thoughts within.</p>

<p><em>Prayer</em> is the duty of the Christian, the duty of every one,
at all times. Our Saviour said, men ought always to pray
and not to faint; and Paul exhorts us to pray without ceasing;
praying always with all prayer. But there are certain times,
when this duty can be performed with more profit, and in a
manner more comforting to ourselves, than at others. Above
all seasons, the Sabbath is appropriate for communion
with God. And he who most frequently and devoutly converses
with Jehovah on his mercy-seat, through Jesus Christ,
on the Lord's day, will commune most with him during the
week, will most profitably observe the Sabbath, and be most
thoroughly furnished for every good word and work. He
will not only enter into rest here on earth, but will daily become
conformed to that better world, where there remaineth
a Sabbath of rest to the people of God.</p>

<p>We must all admit that the sanctification of the Sabbath
is an important part of practical religion. The cause of piety
declines where the Sabbath is not remembered to be kept
holy. But in what does the sanctification of the Lord's day
chiefly consist? We have seen that it is in observing the day
in our own dwellings. This secures the performance of all
its public duties. In a pre-eminent sense, the Sabbath which
God approves, is the <em>Sabbath at home</em>.</p>

<p>No separate argument is then called for to prove that it
is the duty of all to promote the observance of the Lord's day.
It is the common cause of every government, of good morals,
and of religion. Let no one excuse himself from contributing
his part to this good work. We may each aid much in the
sanctification of the Sabbath. It is in the power of the
humblest member of your family to do more to render the
Lord's day profitable, than he can now believe. On the
other hand, an entire household may be thrown into confusion,
and compelled to waste the day, through the perversity or
neglect only of a child. You have a servant in your employ,
to whom certain duties are assigned, but he neglects on Saturday
evening to perform them. Through his omission, the
whole family may be thrown into confusion on Sabbath
morning. One boy of five years old, who <em>will</em> play in the
street, can disturb all the families of the neighbourhood. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>noisy child of three years can effectually prevent, either
parent, brother, or sister, from profitably spending the Lord's
day. A little girl was dressed for church,&mdash;she disobeyed
her mother, and went out to play; her clothes were soon
unfit to be seen in a worshipping assembly. The mother
was fretted and distressed, and the child had to remain at
home, while the parent went to meeting, not in a state of mind
to be much profited by the exercises of the sanctuary. The
sound of one axe, in cleaving as much wood as will make one
fire, can annoy, throughout the fourth part of a village, all who
wish to keep holy the Sabbath day, and to see it hallowed by
others. What is more common, in cases of slight indisposition,
or than in the commencement of disease, to omit sending for the physician
until Sabbath, thus compelling him to spend holy time,
not in ministering to the relief of actual distress, but in sacrificing
to sheer neglect, and contempt of the command of God,
what ought to be <em>his</em> privilege, with all other men,&mdash;the undisturbed
enjoyment, both public and private, of the Lord's day.</p>

<p>Thus we may in different ways, and various degrees, contribute
to the sanctification of the Sabbath, or compel others,
however reluctant, to spend the day without profit. This
power is vested in no one exclusively, but in each member in
particular. Each may contribute to the sanctification of the
Sabbath; each may prevent the entire family from enjoying
and profitably spending the day. Would we do good both to
ourselves and others? Let us <em>every one</em> remember the Sabbath
day <em>at home</em>, to keep it holy.</p>

<p>By this we may be aided in judging of our preparation for
heaven. The Sabbath on earth is a type of the Sabbath above.
If we find no delight in the holy duties of the day, as now
enjoyed, and feel the sacrifice of sanctifying it to be too great,
how can we hope to enjoy it in the purity and holiness of
heaven? But if it is our delight, and its sacred retirement
from worldly cares refreshes the soul, we can discern some
degree of conformity to the inheritance of the saints in light.
It is our duty and our privilege, then, to comfort ourselves
with the expectation of yet enjoying an eternal Sabbath,
where there are no temptations to profane it, no despisers of
religion to interfere with its quiet sanctification&mdash;no ignorance,
through which we may fall into sin, and thus impair our enjoyment,&mdash;no
disinclination of mind to hold communion with
God,&mdash;where no weariness in duty, or languor in devotion
can make the season appear too long.</p>
